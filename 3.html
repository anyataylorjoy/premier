  <p>In the whole of Premier League history, 26th season is under way, forty-three teams have been involved but only six have won the title – Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea, Blackburn, Manchester City and Leicester City - and the Premiership predictions are this trend will continue. Manchester City are current title holders. Manchester United won the most titles, Manchester United have amassed most points in a single season whilst Arsenal are the only team in history to go all season unbeaten. And especially Arsenal’s achievement would have been with big Premier League odds.
