  <p>English teams belong to the strongest on European scene. This has gathered a decent coefficient and ensured top four teams qualify for the Champions League making Premier League betting and Premier League predictions even harder. The fifth placed team automatically qualifies for the Europa League along with the FA Cup and EFL Cup winners. The bottom three Premiership teams get relegated. The top two Championship teams gain automatic promotion to the Premier League, teams finishing in positions three to six compete in a play-off for the last remaining Premier League place. Historically the play-off winner gets the longest Premiership odds to stay up.</p>
